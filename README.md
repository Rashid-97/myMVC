# myMVC

This is my own simple MVC structure I made when I was learning PHP. The main purpose of making it was to understand how this structure
actually works.

I also have made simple ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) classes to interact with some of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, ORACLE and MSSQL.
For database connections I used 'pdo' connectors for 4 databases, 'msqli', 'pgsql', 'dblib' and 'oci_connect'.
There is more functionality for PostreSQL than for the rest.
